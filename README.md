Welcome to Political Tardigrade — a web app developed by three Google STEP interns over the course of approximately five weeks in the summer of 2020. The   mission of Political Tardigrade is to compile and highlight overarching trends in America’s political ad space for students, researchers, and advertisers. By making such data more accessible and easy to analyze, this product aims to promote sociopolitical awareness.

## About The Project

### Background

The Google Transparency Report (https://transparencyreport.google.com/political-ads/home?hl=en) is a comprehensive, open source library of political advertisements hosted on Google services since May of 2018. Political Tardigrade is committed to presenting data from this library, which represents nearly 310 million dollars in cumulative ad spend, in an informative and interactive format — with tools that enable our users to find, visualize, and perform analysis on advertisements.
